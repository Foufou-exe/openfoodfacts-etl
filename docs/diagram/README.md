## Description

This project contains a Conceptual Data Model (CDM) created with Azimutt.

## Azimutt

[**Azimutt**](https://azimutt.app/) is a database visualization and analysis tool that allows you to create entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), facilitating the modeling of relational databases. It is particularly suitable for designing and understanding complex structures.

### Main features of Azimutt:

- Creation of diagrams from SQL files or database connections.
- Highlighting relationships between tables.
- Intuitive interface for navigating and organizing tables.

## Project content

- **JSON file**: The JSON file contains the definition of tables, relationships, and attributes of the CDM. This file was generated and exported from Azimutt.
- **This README**: This document explains the context of the project and the tool used to create the CDM.

## Usage

To view or modify the CDM:

1. Open Azimutt.
2. Import the provided JSON file in this project.
3. Navigate through the tables and relationships to explore the model.

## Advantages of Azimutt for this project

- Simplification of data modeling.
- Clear visualization of relationships between entities.
- Flexibility to add, modify, or delete elements of the model.
